<!-- CHAPTER 3: CREATING A PAGE LAYOUT:

When we use the right tag in right place,it results in better page layout, better
indexing by search engines and better user experience.
We use the following tag to get the job done.

inside the main tag we insert the following tags:
<main> ---- The main opening tag
<section> --- A page section 
<article> --- A self contained content
<aside> --- Content aside from the content(eg Ass etc)
</main> --- The main closing tag

Creating a page like this is not necessary but it creates a readable & structural 
layout 
Also they are useful for SEO.

Link attributes:
<a herf="/contact>"contact us </a> --- contact page opens in some tab
<a herf="/contact"target="_blank>"contact us </a> ---- open in new tab

We can put any content inside an anchor tag(images,headings,etc are all allowed)

If the page is inside a directory, we need to make sure that we link to the correct
page.  ----same applies to img tag as well

We can add links to images like this 
<a herf="/about"><img src='a. spg' width="120"> </a> --- Hieght will be set automatically


THE Dive tag:
dive tag is often used as a container for other elements dive is a block level 
element---- Always takes ful width


The Span tag:
span is an inline containner--- Takes as much width as necessary
